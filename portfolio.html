Dogs can dream while sleeping, and sometimes their paws or faces twitch during it. They communicate through body language, like wagging their tails or barking.

Cats communicate by purring, meowing, and even using their tails to show emotions. A group of cats is called a **clowder**, and kittens are born blind and deaf.
