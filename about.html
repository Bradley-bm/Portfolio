        <h1>Hi, I'm Bradley and I love Math, coding, gaming and playing football</h1>
        <p>I'm the kind of person who's always curious about everything, whether it's school stuff, tech, games, or just random facts. I like to mix fun with learning one minute I'm asking about essays or science, and comparing gaming PCs or talking about Roblox. I've got a creative side too, since I enjoy making up stories, ads, or posters. Honestly, if you come across someone who's playful, creative, and always up for learning something new like me you'll be lucky. I'm basically that friend who always has something interesting to talk about. ðŸ˜…
